# OS Scheduler

CMPE 130 Project

**By:** Derek Nguyen, Tiffany Nguyen, and Sammy Perez

**This is written in C++**

Our project is to create a simulation of an OS scheduler that implements the First In First Out, Shortest Job First, Biggest Job First, Shortest Time to Completion First (preemptive), and Round Robin (preemptive) algorithms to be compared for the optimal choice. Then, we will create our own "solution" based on what we learned in class and compare all of the algorithms once we output them all at once.
